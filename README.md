# KnightsDealistic

The “Knights Dealistic” is a mobile application which helps the students to know about
various deals offered by the stores located in the campus. The application is free to
download from either a mobile phone application store.
Store managers will provide the store deals. And the students of UCF will be able to view
those deals. And there is another type of user called administrator who oversees all the
operations and keeps the information accurate. The administrator can, for instance, verify
store owners and manage user information.
There is a special type of deal called “Big Deal of the Day” which is shown on the top of
the page when the student logs into the application. This deal unlike other deal should be
approved by the administrator. The Big Deal of the day is posted by the store manager and
bids an amount. The admin then decides what would be the Big Deal of the Day depending
on the amount.
There is also a search option provided to students where they can search by food, location
or the store name.
